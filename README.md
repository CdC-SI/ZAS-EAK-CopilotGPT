# ZAS/EAK CopilotGPT

Welcome to the official repository of the ZAS/EAK CopilotGPT challenge, developed as part of the [Innovation Fellowship 2024](https://www.innovationfellowship.ch/). This project is designed to enhance workplace efficiency and foster innovation by providing AI-supported tools that assist employees in their daily tasks.

This repository serves as a proof of concept (PoC), which is slated to conclude in February 2025. However, we are optimistic that the momentum generated by this innovative challenge will attract continued support and development beyond this timeframe.

- **Decision Support:** Provides real-time assistance in decision-making through advanced algorithms.

## How To Contribute

Please check the ```CONTRIBUTORS.md``` file to contribute to the ZAS/EAK CopilotGPT project.

## How it works

The ZAS/EAK CopilotGPT currently features:
- **Question autosuggest**: High quality curated questions (from FAQ) are suggested in the chatbar based on the user input. Validated answers with sources are then returned in the chat. Autocomplete currently supports exact match, fuzzy match and semantic similarity match.
- **RAG**: When no known question/answer pairs are found through autosuggest, RAG is initiated. A semantic similarity search will match the most relevant indexed documents in a vector database and an LLM will generate an answer based on these documents, providing the source of the answer.

## Getting Started

Here you will find instructions for installing and setting up ZAS/EAK CopilotGPT:

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:
- **Git**: Needed for source code management. Install from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Docker**: Required for running containers. Install from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Compose**: Necessary for managing multi-container Docker applications. Install from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Linux users may need to prepend `sudo` to Docker commands depending on their Docker configuration.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Begin by cloning the ZAS/EAK CopilotGPT repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CdC-SI/ZAS-EAK-CopilotGPT.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd ZAS-EAK-CopilotGPT
   ```

2. **Setting Up Environment Variables**

    To use the ZAS/EAK Copilot, you need to set up some environment variables. The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is a required field that must be filled in, all other fields are preconfigured with default settings (but can be configured as well).  Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and fill in the appropriate values:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. **Build Docker Images**

    Build the Docker images using the Docker Compose configuration. This step compiles and launches your Docker environment.

    ```bash docker
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
4. **Verifying the Installation**

    Check the status of the containers to confirm everything is running as expected:
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```
    After the containers are successfully started, verify that the application is running correctly by accessing it through your web browser at http://localhost:4200.

5. **Notes**

    - To add some sample data for FAQ and RAG, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000/apy/indexing/docs/ and make a request to ```/add_faq_data_from_csv``` and ```/add_rag_data_from_csv``` (set ```embed``` parameter to ```true``` to enable semantic search).

    - To index more extensive FAQ data from https://faq.bsv.admin.ch, navigate to http://localhost:8000/apy/indexing/docs and make a request to the ```/index_faq_data``` endpoint.

    - To index more extensive RAG data, navigate to http://localhost:8000/apy/indexing/docs and make a request to the ```/index_html_from_sitemap``` and ```/index_pdfs_from_sitemap``` endpoints (set ```embed``` parameter to ```true``` to enable semantic search).
