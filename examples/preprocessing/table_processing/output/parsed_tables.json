Under certain circumstances, other individuals, such as those working abroad for employers based in Switzerland are also required to pay contributions. This leaflet provides information for employers on salary contributions to the OASI, DI and IC schemes.\n\n# Compulsory contributions\n\n# 1. When does the obligation to pay contributions start?\n\nAll persons in gainful employment are required to pay contributions from 1st January of the year following their 17th birthday. For example, an employee who turns 17 on 15th August 2025 will be required to pay contributions on their salary from 1st January 2026.\n\n|Year of birth|Calendar year 2025|Calendar year 2026|Calendar year 2027|Calendar year 2028|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2007|required to pay|required to pay|required to pay|required to pay|\n|2008|exempt|required to pay|required to pay|required to pay|\n|2009|exempt|exempt|required to pay|required to pay|\n|2010|exempt|exempt|exempt|required to pay|\n\nUntil 31 December of the year in which they turn 20, employees who are members of the business owner’s family only pay contributions based on their cash salary, but from this point onward their contributions will also take account of benefits in kind (e.g. board and accommodation). Please note that the rule is different for apprentices. From 1 January of the year following their 17th birthday, they must pay contributions both on their cash salary and on any benefits in kind they receive."

    "raw_output": "# 2. When does the obligation to pay contributions end?\n\nAs a general rule, the obligation to pay contributions ends when the individual ceases to be gainfully employed.\n\nIf people stop working before reaching the reference age (previously ‘normal retirement age’) they are required to pay contributions as a non-employed person (see leaflet 2.03 – Non-employed contributions to Old-Age and Survivors’ Insurance (OASI), Disability Insurance (DI) and Income Compensation Insurance (IC)).\n\nPeople who continue working beyond the reference age are still required to pay contributions, but can benefit from a personal allowance (see Section 14 and following sections).\n\nThe reference age is 65. For women born before 1964, however, the reference age differs depending on their year of birth:\n\n|Year of birth|Reference age|\n|---|---|\n|Up to 1960|64|\n|1961|64 plus 3 months|\n|1962|64 plus 6 months|\n|1963|64 plus 9 months|\n|From 1964|65|\n\nEmployees who are family members and who are older than the reference age also pay contributions, but only on their cash salary after deduction of the personal allowance (see Section 14 and following sections). Any benefits in kind they receive, such as board and accommodation, are no longer subject to contributions.\n\n# 3. What are the contribution rates?\n\n|Contribution rates| |\n|---|---|\n|OASI|8.7 %|\n|DI|1.4 %|\n|IC|0.5 %|\n|Total|10.6 %|\n\nAs the employer, you deduct half of the contribution (5.3 %) from the employee’s salary and transfer this sum together with your share (also 5.3 %) to the compensation office.

The contribution rates are the same for employers and employees.\n\n# 4 How does the compensation office set contributions using the standard procedure?\n\nThe compensation offices set contributions on account. These are provi - sional contributions based on the employer’s expected total payroll. It is therefore important that you, as the employer, send all the necessary doc- uments to the compensation office so that it can set these contributions on account correctly. You must inform the compensation office as soon as there is any significant change in your total payroll.\n\nThe final contributions will then be determined on the basis of your salary declaration. This declaration must reach the compensation office no later than 30 January following the end of the contribution year. If you fail to meet this deadline, you will have to pay interest on any difference. Many compensation offices will also accept electronic salary declarations, such as ELM, the 'uniform salary declaration'; see www.swissdec.ch).\n\nThe compensation office will calculate the difference between the contri - butions on account which have already been paid and the final contribu - tions:\n\n- If the contributions on account amount to more than the final contri - butions, the compensation office will refund you the difference.\n- If the contributions on account amount to less than the final contribu- tions, the compensation office will issue an invoice for the difference.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, the compensation office may, from the out - set, authorise you as the employer to pay the exact contributions due rather than the calculated provisional contributions. However, this will only be possible on condition that punctual payment is guaranteed."

    "raw_output": "# 5 When are employers required to pay their contributions?\n\nAs an employer, you will be required to pay quarterly if your annual payroll is less than 200 000 francs or monthly if it exceeds this figure. The final payment deadline will always be the tenth day following the end of the quarter or following the end of the month, as the case may be.\n\nFor example, contributions for the first quarter must be paid by 10th April at the latest.\n\nIf the contributions on account amount to less than the final contributions you will receive an invoice which must be paid within 30 days. The time limit is set at 30 days exactly as opposed to one month and cannot be extended. If the last day falls on a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday, the time limit will be extended until the next working day. The time limit will start from one day after the compensation office issues the invoice rather than from the day on which you receive it. In the invoice the compensation office will specify the date by which the sum must reach its account.\n\nPlease note that contributions will only be deemed to have been paid once the payment has reached the compensation office’s account and not when the payment was initiated. If the contributions are not paid on time, default interest will be charged to the employer at a rate of 5 % p.a.\n\n# 6 How are contributions calculated using the simplified procedure?\n\nThe simplified settlement procedure is part of the Federal Act on Measures to Combat Illegal Employment (IEA) and makes it easier for employers to settle social security contributions (OASI/DI/IC/UI/family allowances) and withholding tax. Use of this procedure is on a voluntary basis and is primarily intended for employment relationships which are short-term or involve a small number of working hours, of the type regularly encountered in private households, for example.\n\nThe following conditions must be met:\n\n- the salary of each employee must not exceed 22 680 francs per year (2025);\n- total salaries paid out must not exceed 60 480 francs per year (2025) (twice the maximum annual OASI pension);\n- all salaries must be settled using the simplified procedure for all staff."

    "raw_output": "# 8. When do employers receive credit interest?\n\nIn general, credit interest is paid on salary contributions which have been paid, but were not due and must be refunded or offset by the compensation office. Interest will start to accrue from 1 January following the end of the calendar year in which the contributions that were not due were paid and will continue until such time as the full amount has been refunded. If the contributions on account amount to more than the final contributions and if the compensation office responsible has not refunded the difference within 30 days of receiving the statement, it will pay credit interest. Interest will accrue from the date on which the full statement is received by the compensation office.\n\n# 9. How is the interest calculated?\n\nInterest is calculated on a daily basis, with one month being counted as equivalent to 30 days and one calendar year being counted as equivalent to 360 days. The interest rate is a standard rate of 5 %.\n\nFor example:\n\n|Contributions on account:|40,000 francs|\n|---|---|\n|Final contributions:|100,000 francs|\n|Difference between contributions on account and final contributions:|60,000 francs|\n|Invoice issued by compensation office:|24 February 2025|\n|Received by employer:|26 February 2025|\n|Payment received by compensation office:|2 April 2025|\n|Default interest from 25 February to 2 April 2025 (38 days):|60,000 francs x (38 days/360 days) x 5% = 316.70 francs|"

    "raw_output": "# Contributions on retrospective salary payments\n\n# 20. When is a salary payment referred to as retrospective?\n\nIf a salary is not paid straight away at the end of a given pay interval, this is referred to as a 'retrospective salary payment'. Examples include shares of profits, commission payments, bonuses, directors’ fees and royalties.\n\n# 21. How is an individual’s liability to pay contributions determined?\n\nWhen determining an individual’s liability to pay contributions on retrospective salary payments, the decisive criterion is the date when the work in question was carried out and not the date when the salary payment was made.\n\nIf the employee was insured and subject to compulsory contributions at the time when he or she engaged in the relevant work, contributions must therefore be paid on the retrospective salary payments.\n\nFor example, let us take the case of a young man who starts an apprenticeship on 1st May 2024 and turns 17 on 1st October of the same year. This means that he will become subject to compulsory OASI contributions on 1st January 2025. In May 2025, the young man is awarded a bonus for the first year of his apprenticeship (May 2024–April 2025). Since he has had to pay OASI contributions since January 2025, he will only be liable to pay contributions on one third of this bonus (i.e. for the four months from January to April 2025).\n\n# 22. What date is decisive for purposes of calculating contributions?\n\nThe decisive date for the calculation of contributions on retrospective salary payments is the date when the salary is paid and not the date on which the relevant work was carried out. This means that the contribution is calculated according to the rates, personal allowances and maximum limits applicable at the time of the salary payment. Subject to Section 23.\n\nExample: If an employee receives a retrospective bonus in 2025, the contribution rates and allowances for 2025 will apply even if the bonus relates to paying work he carried out in 2024."

This information must be reported separately for each calendar year. This is essential if the compensation office is to enter the income of insured persons correctly in their individual account with a view to ensuring that they are not placed at a disadvantage when their pension is calculated.\n\nRetrospective salary payments not mentioned in this section do not need to be listed separately on the employee’s salary certificate. They can be reported together with salary payments for the current calendar year.\n\nSpecial rules apply to written requests submitted by employees. If an employee can prove that their income which is subject to compulsory contributions originated from paying work performed in an earlier year when their contributions fell short of the required minimum amount, the compensation office will reassign income earned from gainful employment and already recorded in the year in which the salary was paid to the year when the person carried out the paying work. The compensation office will only review requests that were submitted prior to the occurrence of the insured event."

These payments form part of the employee’s relevant salary.\n\nThe compensation payments paid by the military insurance scheme are settled according to the scheme rules.\n\nWhen agricultural workers perform military or civilian service, the compensation office will also finance the contributions paid by agricultural employers on their employees’ wages in accordance with the Federal Act on Family Allowances for Agricultural Workers (AFAA, see leaflet 6.09 – Familienzulagen in der Landwirtschaft (Family Allowances in Agriculture)).\n\n# 25 Can employees request direct payment of compensation?\n\nThe compensation fund can only pay compensation directly in exceptional cases.
